            <p>Hello! I'm Nathan Sweeney, a dynamic professional transitioning into the exciting world of full stack development. Based in Liverpool, I bring extensive experience in international trade and logistics, particularly within the food commodities and shipping industries. My career so far has been marked by a proven track record of streamlining complex supply chains and enhancing operational efficiencies, significantly contributing to the profitability and growth of the businesses Iâ€™ve worked with.</p>
            <p>Now, I am channeling my analytical approach, attention to detail, and leadership skills into full stack development. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am dedicated to creating responsive, user-friendly web applications. I am currently in training, working on projects that will be showcased on this site over the next year.</p>
            <p>My expertise in contract negotiation, customer relationship management, and regulatory compliance has equipped me with a unique perspective that I am excited to bring into tech. As I continue to develop my skills, I look forward to combining my business acumen with innovative web development solutions.</p>
            <p>Whether managing high-stakes negotiations or building the next great web application, I am committed to exceeding expectations. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on impactful projects!</p>
